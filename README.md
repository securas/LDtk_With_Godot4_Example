An example of how I use LDtk 1.4.1 and Godot 4.2.1

The license for the code is MIT but the license for the assets is whatever the author determines as described here: https://opengameart.org/content/arcade-platformer-assets

This also includes a bunch of extra stuff like:
- automatically transitioning between rooms
- (trying to ) load the entire game and entities
- load level pngs generated by LDtk for ease of use
- place the player node in world.tscn to start at any point in the map
- player control
- zero enemy AI... cause I'm lazy
- camera controller (more or less behaved pixel perfect)
- a simple FSM
- code to manage damage
- a simple menu
- saving and loading encrypted game files
